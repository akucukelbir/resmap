ResMap in Scipion
==========================
Why a different branch of ResMap for Scipion?

----------------
We have done a re-factoring of ResMap code to
separate the computing code from the visualization
code. With this new approach we could build a 'wizard'
in Scipion using the same ResMap pre-whitening figure.
We could also display the results many times after computed
and through the Web.
