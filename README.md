How Do I Use It?
----------------
Please read the documentation within the source files.

What Should I Download?
-----------------------
Sourceforge should automatically present you with the latest binary for your platform.

The binaries have been packaged using PyInstaller and were tested on:

* Windows: 7 and 8
* Mac: 10.6+
* Linux: Fedora 14+, CentOS 6+

You may also download the source files (Python) and run them using your own Python setup.

Requirements are:

* Python (2.7+)
* NumPy (1.6+)
* SciPy (0.11+)

We have also provided two test volumes (under test-data) of a symmetric "chirp signal" with two levels of noise.
